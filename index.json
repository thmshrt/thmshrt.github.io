[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Thomas Hart is a graduate student of computational biology in the Krumsiek Lab at the Weill Cornell Medical Center. His current research projects are focused on characterizing the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer using spatial metabolomics and developing performant visualization methods to efficiently describe high dimensional data. More broadly, his research interests include multiomic integration, data fusion methods, and literate programming for efficiently distributing scientific knowledge. Thomas actively supports open source science by frequently publishing packages in a variety of languages to various repositories including github and CRAN.\nOutside of his research, Thomas can be found hiking in the nearest mountains, looking for the next best burger or taking in shows on Broadway. He actively works to pass on these passions to others through his work with the National Ski Patrol and National Park Service, No Kid Hungry, and supporting Broadway actors via The Actors Fund.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://thmshrt.github.io/author/thomas-hart/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/thomas-hart/","section":"authors","summary":"Thomas Hart is a graduate student of computational biology in the Krumsiek Lab at the Weill Cornell Medical Center.
